    "Ans: Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting by using two main techniques: bagging and random feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging, which stands for bootstrap aggregating, is a technique that involves creating multiple subsets of the original dataset by randomly sampling with replacement. Each subset is then used to train a decision tree, and the final prediction is made by combining the predictions of all the decision trees. By using different subsets of the data, the random forest model can learn from different variations of the dataset, which helps to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random feature selection is another technique used by random forest regressors to reduce the risk of overfitting. When constructing each decision tree, only a random subset of features is considered for splitting at each node. This means that each decision tree in the random forest model is trained on a different subset of features, which helps to reduce the correlation between the trees and improve the generalization ability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining bagging and random feature selection, random forest regressor is able to reduce the variance in the model and therefore reduce the risk of overfitting. This makes it a popular choice for machine learning tasks where overfitting is a concern."
